        "Hindi is the world's third-most spoken language. Giving it scale: approximately 8 in every hundred people speak Hindi! With such a large population of the world communicating and spending their day-to-day lives immersed in this language and its culture, it is disheartening that the availability of high-quality language models specifically trained on Hindi data remains a significant challenge.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aims to address this gap by adapting Gemma 2 to effectively generate fluent and culturally sensitive Hindi text. By fine-tuning the model on a carefully curated dataset of high-quality Hindi text, I aim to improve its performance on various NLP tasks, such as text generation, translation, and question answering."

The data is crawled from DailyHunt, a popular news aggregator in India that pulls high-quality articles from multiple trusted and reputed news publishers.\n",

Its diverse nature, encompassing articles from various sources, exposes the model to a wide range of linguistic styles, vocabulary, and real-world contexts. By training on this data, we can expect Llama-2 to learn robust representations of the Hindi language, capturing its nuances and complexities."
